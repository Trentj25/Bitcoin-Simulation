Simulating the impact of volitily based selling on the return of a portfolio of bitcoin. 

•	Each day, for each coin in their wallet, all three groups calculate the difference between the buy price and the market price. If the absolute value of the difference (Sell – Buy) is greater than the Annual Volatility - recalculated each day - (i.e., they’ve gained or lost more than they can expect to gain/lose in the coming year), they consider selling. This means, early on, players consider selling coins bought for $10 on a $2 drop/rise in price; later, players consider selling coins purchased for $25K when the price rises/contracts by $15K.
Group A:
•	Never sells. At the end of 5,000 days, they will hold 5,000 BTC (Benchmark Group). Groups B and C make their sell decisions based on knowledge of past volatility.
Group B:
•	When Gains/Losses > Annual Volatility for any coin, they roll a pair of 6-sided dice. They only sell if they roll snake-eyes (1+1). If any of the 35 other dice combinations come up, they hold and repeat the next day with a new price and updated volatility.
o	This process takes place each day for every coin held that day.
Group C:
•	Similar to Group B, except they roll a pair of 4-sided dice. When the condition is triggered, they have a 1 in 16 chance of selling vs. B’s 1 in 36 chance.
